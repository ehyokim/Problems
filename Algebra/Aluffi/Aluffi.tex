Problem 10.2: Show that groups are "group objects in the category of sets"
	
\begin{proof}
	Take the morphism $m: G \times G \rightarrow G$ to be the morphism that takes the Cartesian product of a group $G$ and maps it to itself via its multiplication table. Let $e: 1 \rightarrow G$ be the morphism that takes the set with a unique element and maps its element to the identity of $G$ and $i: G \rightarrow G$ be the morphism which maps every element in $G$ to its inverse. The diagrams shown in the figure on page 116 commute with these morphisms as we can easily check.  
\end{proof} 

Problem 10.3: Let $(G,\cdot)$ be a group, and suppose $\circ: G \times G \rightarrow G$ is a group homomorphism (w.r.t $cdot$) such that $(G, \circ)$ is also a group. Prove that $\circ$ and $\cdot$ coincide.
