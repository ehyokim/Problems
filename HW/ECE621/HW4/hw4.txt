1. General CSS codes.

a) Show that any distance 3 CSS code can correct any single qubit error and a two-qubit error composed of one Z and one X.

b) For any distance 2k+1 CSS code, describe the set of errors that can be corrected.

c) Specific codes can correct more errors. Show the Steane [7,1,3] code can only correct the minimal number of errors. Identify the extra errors that the Shor [9,1,3] code can correct.

 

2) 16 Qubit Shor Code

Consdier the 16 qubit Shor code

Let's label each qubit by coordinates i,j ona grid with i and j from 0 to 3

The Z stabilizers are  Zi,jZi,j+1 are for i=0 to 3 and j=0 to 2

The X stabilizers are Xi,0Xi+1,0Xi,1Xi+1,1Xi,2Xi+1,2Xi,3Xi+1,3 for i=0 to 2

a) Write down the stabilizers in the binary form.

b) Identify the classical codes C1 and C2. (Find H and G. Does not need to be in standard form.)

c) Show that C2 is in C1

d) What is the distance and number of encoded bits for C2 and C1?

e) What is the disance and number of encoded qubits for the quantum code?

f) Find minimal weight logical operators X and Z.
