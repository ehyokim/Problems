Problem 1: Stabilizers and Cliffords

a) Show the state |0>|+>|+i> is stabilized by the group generated by <ZII,IXI, IIY>

b) Write down an alternative set of generators.

c) Find a gate sequence composed of CNOT, H, and S=|0><0|+i|1><1|,  (you can write the circuit, if you wish), that transforms the state above into a state stabilized by <XXX,ZZI,IZZ>=].

d) Write the wavefunction of the state above.

Problem 2: Quantum Error Correction Code

Your friend Andrew Cross tells you that he has a code on 7 qubits that is stabilized by the following generators

<Z1Z5, Z2Z5, Z3Z6, Z4Z7, X3X4Y6Y7, X1X2X3Z4X5X6>

or

<ZIIIZII, IZIIZII, IIZIIZI, IIIZIIZ, IIXXIYY, XXXZXXI>

1) Show that this code can correct any single qubit error.

2) Determine logical Z and X operators for this code.

3) Show that transforming the stabilizer generators by applying a single qubit clifford gate to any qubit still yields a code that corrects all single qubit errors.
