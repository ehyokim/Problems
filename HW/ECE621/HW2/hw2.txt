Problem 1: Groups

Let G be a group generated by three elements a, b, and c that are self inverses under the group operation •.

G=<a,b,c>

a•a=b•b=c•c=1

a,b, and c are different elements

 

a) What is the inverse of g=a•b•c?

b) H is a subgroup of G if it satisfies all the properties of being a group and contains only elements in G.  Show that H=<a,b> is a subgroup of G and K=<a> is a subgroup of G.

c) Let's assume the elements are three bit strings and the operation is bitwise addition modulo 2, show that   a=001, b=010,  and c=100 satisfies the constraints of G.  The order of the group|G| is the number of elements in G.  How many elements are there in this case? How about for |H| and |K| from problem (b)?

d) Now let's assume the elements are Pauli matrices, a=X, b=Y, c=Z, under multiplication. What are |G|, |H|, and |K| now?

e) Compare 1.c and 1.d and explain to a high-school student why the values differ.

f) Given the constraints on G at the start of the problem, what size |G| are possible?

h) Bonus problem: Explicitly find a G that is not G in 1.c or G in 1.d.

 

 

Problem 2: Encoding 3 bits against bit flip errors

 

Consider three codes for encoding three bits: C1 is the (9,3,3) triple modular redundancy code, C2 is the (7,4,3) Hamming code (treat the 4th bit as being always set to 0 (let Bob use this information)), and C3=Dual(C2) the (7,3,4) code. Assume that each bit is sent over the same binary symmetric channel with a 10% probability of flipping the bit.

 

a) What is the channel capacity of a 10% binary symmetric channel?

b) What is the average probability that Bob can successfully decode the codeword for the three codes.

c) How does the channel capacity of each code per bit, compare to the channel capacity? (Assume Alice sends a uniform random distribution of 3 bit codewords).

d) Which code should you use?

 

Problem 3. Error Channels

Consider two error channels: the amplitude damping channel and the phase damping channel. The Kraus Operators for these channels are defined in the notes in Section 6.6 .

a) Rewrite the channels in terms of Pauli matrices

ρ'=Σi,j  μi,j  σiρσj

where σ0=I,σ1=X,σ2=Y,σ3=Z

b) Show that the phase damping channel  with parameter p is equivalent to a channel that applies a Z operator with probability q for q <1/2 and otherwise applies the  `tggtg identity. What is the relationship between p and q? 

c) (doesn't need a) Write the channels as unitary operations acting on the system qubit and extra environmental qubits. 

e) Write down a quantum circuit that generates the error channel N(ρ)=(1-p)ρ+ px XρX+py YρY+pz ZρZ for p=px+py+pz where p<1 and px, py, and pz >0
