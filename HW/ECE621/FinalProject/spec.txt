 Instructions

The goal of the final project is to cover an aspect of quantum information not covered in the class.  There are three types of projects: numerical computation, and literature review. Project report should be 4-6 pages not including references. 

Numerical Computation

The simulation of quantum error correction codes under different noise models is an important part of testing the properties of quantum error correction codes.  Choose a small code and a noise model and compare the properties in the code capacity model and the phenomenological model.

Literature Review

Choose a topic not covered in detail in the class and prepare a literature review.  Possible topics include

    Decoherence Free Subspaces
    Finite Rate Quantum Codes
    Qudit Codes
    Continuous Variable QEC
    Bosonic Codes
    Current results and questions in quantum channel capacities

Timeline

Grading Rubric

10% Slides /In Class Presentation

50% Report Quality (Structure, Layout, Figures, etc.)

20% Completeness (Numerical: How extensive are the calculations?  Review: Is the literature well covered? ) 

20% Analysis (Numerical: Discussion of challenges and limits and suggestions for missing tools. Review: Discussion of importance of topic in the broader field and possible extensions.)
