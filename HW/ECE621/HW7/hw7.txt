Read Sections I-IV of https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3747 by Tomita and Svore

1. Write down the [[n,k,d]] code parameters for Surface-13, Surface-17, and Surface-25 codes.

2. In Figure 5, two circuits are presented for measuring the same X stabilizer that only differ by the order of CNOTS.  Explain why the order matters.

3. Explain why changing the ordering of CNOTs with a single qubit syndrome measurement does not help for the [[7,1,3]] Steane code.

In https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04795 Fig. 21, Appendix C, Kim and Yoder show that a two-qubit Cat state is sufficient for FT syndrome extraction given the presented connection between the syndrome qubits and the data.

4. Write down the quantum circuit for one round of syndrome extraction.

5. Write down an algorithm for a look up table decoder based on three measurements in the style of the decoder presented in III.A of Tomita and Svore.
